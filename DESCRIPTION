Description: Perform hierarchical Bayesian analysis of North
  American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. 'bbsBayes' will run a full
  model analysis for one or more species that you choose, or you can take
  more control and specify how the data should be stratified, prepared
  for JAGS, or modelled. The functions provided here allow you to replicate
  analyses performed by the USGS (see Link and Sauer (2011) 
  <doi: 10.1525/auk.2010.09220>) and CWS (see Smith and Edwards (2020) 
  <doi: 10.1101/2020.03.26.010215>).
